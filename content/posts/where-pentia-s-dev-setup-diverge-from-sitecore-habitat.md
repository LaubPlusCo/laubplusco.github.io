title: Where Pentia's dev setup diverge from Sitecore Habitat
url: /

---
Sitecore Habitat showcase an almost full approach for setting up your Sitecore solutions. But does it fit everyone? It is not intended to do so.

The important lesson to get from Sitecore Habitat is the architecture. The various technologies used and how the development environment is configured are only meant as an inspiration for how it can be done.

At Pentia the Modular Architecture is nothing new but the development setup that Habitat presented had some cool new stuff which we had not embraced fully yet. For example Unicorn and Gulp.

Instead of just copy-pasting from Habitat we have revised our own setup which is an always evolving process.

In this post I will present some major divergences between our current setup and the one found in Habitat.

The purpose of this is to inspire others to make their own tweaks on the setup and share their reasoning and experiences with the community.Project and folder structure

Test projects

Serialization

Gulp tasks
