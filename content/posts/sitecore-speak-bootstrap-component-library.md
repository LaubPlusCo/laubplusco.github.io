## What is Bootstrap?

Bootstrap is a CSS, JS and HTML framework that includes a standard grid system and loads of common components  .

The grid system is so simple to use so that even an old-time C programmer as me can relate to it and understand how to use it. To some degree at least, I am still no frontend-wiz and never will be.

And now for some code..
