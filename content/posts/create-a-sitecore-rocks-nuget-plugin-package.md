_This post is the first in a series of two, this post will show how to create a simple Sitecore Rocks plugin whilst the second will show how to push the plugin to Sitecore Rocks myGet._

Sitecore Rocks uses a myGetÂ https://www.myget.org/gallery/sitecorerocks repository to which you can push your own custom plugins.
